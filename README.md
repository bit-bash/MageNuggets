# MageNuggets 7.1.0

WoW MageNuggets Addon (unoffical) for DragonFlight pre-patch (WoW 10).

This is my "hack" of MageNuggets (core code) to get it working with DragonFlight (WoW 10).

I am NOT a LUA expert by any stretch of the imagination. Use at your own risk.

I have NOT tested every aspect of this Addon, so stuff can still break (early and often).

In the portal Dialog Box, when you click on a portal icon, the Dialog Box is now dismissed (why keep it up?).

For those Alliance players used to MageNuggets in the past, I have reordered the teleport/portal icons in sort of an expansion order.

I don't have a Horde Mage character, so I haven't tested anything "For the Horde!".  Also, I have no Moonkin testing either.

Kudos and huge grats to B-Buck for creating this Addon - I am humbled by your 1337 skillz.

This is still a work-in-progress - stay tuned.
