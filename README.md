# MageNuggets
WoW MageNuggets Addon (unoffical) for DragonFlight.
This is my "hack" of MageNuggets (core code) to get it working with DragonFlight (WoW 10).
I am NOT a LUA expert by any stretch of the immagination. Use at your own risk.
I have NOT testest every aspect of this Addon, so stuff can still break (early and often).
For those Alliance players used to MageNuggets in the past, I have reordered the teleport/portal icons in sort of an expansion order.
In the portal Dialog Box, when you click on a portal icon, the Dialog Box is now dismissed (why keep it up?).
I don't have a Horde Mage character, so I haven't tested anything "For the Horde!".
Kudos and huge grats to B-Buck for creating this Addon - I am humbled by your 1337 skillz.
This is still a work-in-progress - stay tuned.
